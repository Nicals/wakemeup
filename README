I use to use J. Nightingale's beep in combination with at command as
an alarm clock. It work well, but it wasn't great to switch on (select
the beep melody) or off (need to kill a background process).

I didn't wanted to write something great, just something usefull. In
fact, it was written just before going to sleep in order to get a full
scale test.

I use to use J. Nightingale's beep in combination with at command as
an alarm clock. It work well, but it wasn't great to switch on (select
the beep melody) or off (need to kill a background process).

I didn't wanted to write something great, just something usefull. In
fact, it was written just before going to sleep in order to get a full
scale test rapidly.

Beware, wakemeup launches instance of beep and store a file containing
the pid of this beep instance in $HOME/.wakemeup.pid
On multi-user system, you don't wan't several user to launch wakemeup
in the same time.

If for any reason you wan't to contact me:
